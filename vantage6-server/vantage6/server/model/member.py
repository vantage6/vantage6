The Member table is used to link organizations and collaborations together.
Each line in the table represents that a certain organization is member
of a certain collaboration by storing the ids of the organization and
collaboration.

The StudyMember table is used to link organizations and studies together. A study
is a subset of organizations that form a collaboration. The table is structured in the
same way as the Member table.
