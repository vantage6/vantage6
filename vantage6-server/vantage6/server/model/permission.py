"""
The Permission table defines which roles have been assigned to which users.
It can contain multiple entries for the same user if they have been assigned
multiple roles.

The UserPermission table defines which extra rules have been assigned to which
users. Apart from roles, users may be assigned extra permissions that allow
them to execute one specific action. This table is used to store those, and
may contain multiple entries for the same user.
