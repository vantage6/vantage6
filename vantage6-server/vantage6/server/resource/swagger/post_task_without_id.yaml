summary: Adds new computation task

description: |
  Creates a new task within a collaboration. If no `organization_ids` are given the task is send to all organizations within the collaboration. The endpoint can be accessed by both a `User` and `Container`.
  ## Accessed as `User`
  When this endpoint is accessed by a `User` a new `run_id` is created. The user needs to be within a organization that is part of the collaboration to which the task is posted.
  ## Accessed as `Container`
  When this endpoint is accessed by a `Container` it is considered to be a child-task of the `Container`, and will get the `run_id` from the initial task. This does not have to be the same as the parent task, as it is possible that sub-tasks have sub-tasks themselfs. The container has limited permissions to create tasks, it is only allowed to create tasks in the same collaboration using the same image.
  ## Accessed as `Node`
  Nodes do not have permission to create tasks. This will return `401`.
