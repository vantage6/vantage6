This repository is contains all the **vantage6** infrastructure source code. The **vantage6** technology enables to manage and deploy privacy enhancing technologies like Federated Learning (FL) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC). Please visit our [website](https://vantage6.ai) to learn more!

You can find more (user) documentation at [readthedocs](https://docs.vantage6.ai). If you have any questions, suggestions or just want to chat about federated learning: join our [Discord)](https://discord.gg/yAyFf6Y) channel.

## Infrastructure overview

![Vantage6 architecture overview](docs/images/overview-infrastructure.png)

_A High level overview of the vantage6 infrastructure. Vantage6 has both a
client-server and peer-to-peer architecture. The client is used by the researcher to
create (PET) computation requests. It is also used to manage users, organizations and
collaborations. The server contains users, organizations, collaborations, tasks and
their results. It provides a central access point for both the clients and nodes. The
nodes have access to privacy sensitive data and handle computation requests retrieved
from the server. Computation request are executed as separate containers on the node.
These containers are connected to containers at other nodes by a internal network._

## :books: Quickstart

### Requirements

The **vantage6** infrastructure is delivered in Docker images. To run these images, you
need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed. To install the
latest version of the vantage6 CLI, you need to have
[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) v3.13. We recommend
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for package management.

Install the latest version of the vantage6 CLI by using:

```bash
uv add vantage6
# or, if you are using conda / pyenv / ...
pip install vantage6
```

This installs the `v6` commands, which allows you to manage your nodes and servers. To
view all available options, run:

```bash
v6 --help
```

For example you can create a local test setup by using:

```bash
v6 dev create-demo-network
```

This creates a local network with a server and two nodes. You can start the network by running:

```bash
v6 dev start-demo-network
```

This will start the server and nodes in the background. You can view the logs by running:

```bash
# View node logs
v6 node attach

# View server logs
v6 server attach
```

From here you can use the [vantage6-client](https://pypi.org/project/vantage6-client)
to interact with the server. The demo network has a pre-configured organization with
the following credentials:

- Username: `dev_admin`
- Password: `password`

For example, you can create a new organization by running:

```python
from vantage6.client import Client

client = Client(
  server_url='http://127.0.0.1:7601/api',
  auth_url='http://127.0.0.1:8080',
  log_level='debug'
)
client.authenticate()
client.setup_encryption(None)

client.organization.create(
    name='My organization',
    address1='My address',
    address2='My address',
    zipcode='1234AB',
    country='The Netherlands',
    domain='my-organization.com'
)
```

You can find more (user) documentation at [readthedocs](https://docs.vantage6.ai)

## Project structure

### PYPI packages

This repository is home to 8 PyPI packages:

- [vantage6](https://pypi.org/project/vantage6) -> _CLI for managing node and server instances_
- [vantage6-client](https://pypi.org/project/vantage6-client) -> _Python client for interacting with the vantage6-server_
- [vantage6-algorithm-tools](https://pypi.org/project/vantage6-algorithm-tools) -> _Python tools to facilitate algorithm development_
- [vantage6-node](https://pypi.org/project/vantage6-node) -> _Node application package_
- [vantage6-server](https://pypi.org/project/vantage6-server) -> _Server application package_
- [vantage6-algorithm-store](https://pypi.org/project/vantage6-algorithm-store) -> _Algorithm store application package_
- [vantage6-common](https://pypi.org/project/vantage6-common) -> _Package with common vantage6 functions_
- [vantage6-backend-common](https://pypi.org/project/vantage6-backend-common) -> _Package with functions common to central server and algorithm store_

**Note that when using vantage6 you do not install the _server_ and _node_ packages. These are delivered to you in Docker images.**

This repository also hosts the code for the vantage6 user interface (UI). The UI
is an Angular web application that can be used to interact with the vantage6 server
easily.

### Docker images

The vantage6 infrastructure is delivered in Docker images. All Docker images are stored
in our private [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) registry. The most important images are:

- `harbor2.vantage6.ai/infrastructure/node:VERSION` -> _Node application Docker image_
- `harbor2.vantage6.ai/infrastructure/server:VERSION` -> _Server application Docker image_
- `harbor2.vantage6.ai/infrastructure/ui:VERSION` -> _User interface Docker image_
- `harbor2.vantage6.ai/infrastructure/algorithm-store:VERSION` -> _Algorithm store Docker image_

with `VERSION` being the full semantic version of the vantage6 infrastructure, e.g.
`4.0.0` or `4.1.0rc0`.

And finally there are some images released for algorithm development:

- `harbor2.vantage6.ai/infrastructure/algorithm-base:MAJOR.MINOR` -> _Base image for algorithm development_
- `harbor2.vantage6.ai/infrastructure/algorithm-ohdsi-base:MAJOR.MINOR` -> _Extended algorithm base image for OHDSI algorithm development_
