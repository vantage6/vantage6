# We only need to ignore files that are automatically generated by the OS or
# by the IDE. This because all charts are part of sub-directories, so there
# is no need to exclude project specific files that are outside of the `/chart`
# folder. We do exclude IDE files/folders as a dev might open these sub folders
# directly.

# Ignore MacOS folder attributes file
.DS_Store

# Exclude Git files
.git/
.gitignore

# Exclude VSCode files
.vscode/
*.code-workspace
