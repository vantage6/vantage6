Algorithm Development
=====================

This section helps you to develop MPC and FL algorithms that are compatible
with vantage6. You are **not** going to find a list of algorithms here or help
on how to use them. In the :ref:`main-intro`, the basic
concepts and interface between node and algorithm are explained. Then, in the
:ref:`algo-dev-guide`, the algorithm development process is explained. Finally,
in the :ref:`classic-algo-tutorial`, an FL algorithm is build from scratch.

.. warning::

    Note that the classic tutorial is not outdated, and the commands may be
    wrong. Nevertheless, the concepts are still valid and the tutorial is
    still useful to get a grasp of the vantage6 framework.
