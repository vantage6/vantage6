.. _server-api:

API
---

The API can be called via HTTP requests from a programming language of your
choice.

.. note::

    In older versions, you could explore how to use the server API on
    ``https://<serverdomain>/apidocs`` (e.g. https://cotopaxi.vantage6.ai/apidocs for
    the Cotopaxi server). From version 4.11, however, this documentation
    has been removed because the package supplying it was no longer maintained. We plan
    to provide similar support in the future.
