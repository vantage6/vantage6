.. _hq-api:

API
---

Both the vantage6 HQ and the algorithm store have an API. These APIs can be called via
HTTP requests from a programming language of your choice.

.. note::

    In older versions, you could explore how to use the HQ API on
    ``https://<my-v6-HQ>/apidocs`` (e.g. https://uluru.vantage6.ai/apidocs for
    the Uluru HQ). From version 4.11 onwards, however, this documentation
    has been removed because the package supplying it was no longer maintained. We plan
    to provide similar support in the future but at present, this is unfortunately not
    available.
