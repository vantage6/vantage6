.. _ui:

User interface
--------------

The User Interface (UI) is a website where you can login with your vantage6
user account. Which website this is, depends on the vantage6 hub you are
using. If you are using the Uluru community service, go to
https://portal.uluru.vantage6.ai and login with your user account.

Using the UI should be relatively straightforward. There are buttons
that should help you e.g. create a task or change your password. If
anything is unclear, please contact us via
`Discord <https://discord.com/invite/yAyFf6Y>`__.

.. note::
    If you are a hub administrator and want to set up a user interface, see
    :ref:`this section <install-ui>` on deploying a UI.

.. note::
    If you are :ref:`running your own hub <use-hub>` locally with ``v6 sandbox``
    or ``v6 dev`` commands, the UI is started together with the network. How to use
    these commands is explained :ref:`here <local-test>`.
