Mailserver
===========

Some features of the server require an SMTP server to send emails. For example,
the server can send an email to a user when they lost their password. There
are many ways to set up an SMTP server, and we will not go into detail here.
Just remember that you need to configure the server to use your SMTP server
(see :ref:`server-config-file-structure`).
