Install optional components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are several optional components that you can set up apart from the
vantage6 server itself.

:ref:`install-ui`
  An application that will allow your server's users to interact more easily
  with your vantage6 server.

:ref:`docker-registry`
  A (private) Docker registry can be used to store algorithms but it is also
  possible to use the (public) `Docker hub <https://hub.docker.com/>`__ to
  upload your Docker images. For production scenarios, we recommend using a
  private registry.

:ref:`eduvpn-install`
  If you want to enable algorithm containers that are running on different
  nodes, to directly communicate with one another, you require an eduVPN server
  version 3.

:ref:`rabbitmq-install`
  If you have a server with a high workload whose performance you want to
  improve, you may want to set up a RabbitMQ service which enables horizontal
  scaling of the Vantage6 server.


:ref:`smtp-server`
  If you want to send emails to your users, e.g. to help them reset their
  password, you need to set up an SMTP server.

Below, we explain how to install and deploy these components.

.. _install-ui:

User Interface
""""""""""""""

The User Interface (UI) is a web application that will make it easier for your
users to interact with the server. It allows you to manage all your resources
(such as creating collaborations, editing users, or viewing tasks),
except for creating new tasks. We aim to incorporate this functionality
in the near future.

To run the UI, we also provide a Docker image. Below is an example of how you may
deploy a UI using Docker compose; obviously, you may need to adjust the configuration
to your own environment.

.. code:: yaml

    name: run-ui
    services:
      ui:
        image: harbor2.vantage6.ai/infrastructure/ui:cotopaxi
        ports:
          - "8000:80"
        environment:
          - SERVER_URL=https://<url_to_my_server>
          - API_PATH=/api

Alternatively, you can also run the UI locally with Angular. In that case, follow the
instructions on the `UI Github page <https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/tree/main/vantage6-ui>`__

.. _docker-registry:

Docker registry
"""""""""""""""

A Docker registry or repository provides storage and versioning for Docker
images. Installing a private Docker registry is useful if you don't want to
share your algorithms. Also, a private registry may have security benefits,
for example, you can scan your images for vulnerabilities and you can limit
the range of IP addresses that the node may access to its server and the
private registry.

.. note::

  If you use your own registry, make sure that it conforms to the
  `OCI distribution specification <https://distribution.github.io/distribution/spec/api/>`_.
  This specification is supported by all major container registry providers, such
  as Docker Hub, Harbor, Azure Container Registry and Github container registry.

Harbor
~~~~~~

Our preferred solution for hosting a Docker registry is
`Harbor <https://goharbor.io>`_. Harbor provides access control, a user
interface and automated scanning on vulnerabilities.

Docker Hub
~~~~~~~~~~

Docker itself provides a registry as a turn-key solution on Docker Hub.
Instructions for setting it up can be found here:
https://hub.docker.com/_/registry.

Note that some features of vantage6, such as timestamp based retrieval of the
newest image, or multi-arch images, are not supported by the Docker Hub
registry.

.. note::

  If you are using a private docker registry, your nodes need to login to it in order
  to be able to retrieve the algorithms. You can do this by adding the following
  to the node configuration file:

  .. code:: yaml

      docker_registries:
        - registry: docker-registry.org
          username: docker-registry-user
          password: docker-registry-password

.. _eduvpn-install:

EduVPN
""""""

EduVPN is an optional server component that enables the use of algorithms
that require node-to-node communication.

`EduVPN <https://www.eduvpn.org/>`_ provides an API for the OpenVPN
server, which is required for automated certificate retrieval by the
nodes. Like vantage6, it is an open source platform.

The following documentation shows you how to install EduVPN:

- `Debian 11, 12 <https://docs.eduvpn.org/server/v3/deploy-debian.html>`_
- `Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, 24.04 LTS  <https://docs.eduvpn.org/server/v3/deploy-debian.html>`_
- `Fedora 39, 40 <https://docs.eduvpn.org/server/v3/deploy-fedora.html>`_
- `Enterprise Linux <https://docs.eduvpn.org/server/v3/deploy-el.html>`_

After the installation is done, you need to configure the server to:

1. Enable client-to-client communication. This can be achieved in the
   configuration file by the ``clientToClient`` setting (see
   `here <https://github.com/eduvpn/documentation/blob/v2/PROFILE_CONFIG.md>`__).
2. Do not block LAN communication (set ``blockLan`` to ``false``). This
   allows your docker subnetworks to continue to communicate, which is
   required for vantage6 to function normally.
3. Enable `port
   sharing <https://github.com/eduvpn/documentation/blob/v2/PORT_SHARING.md>`__
   (Optional). This may be useful if the nodes are behind a strict
   firewall. Port sharing allows nodes to connect to the VPN server only
   using outgoing ``tcp/443``. Be aware that `TCP
   meltdown <https://openvpn.net/faq/what-is-tcp-meltdown/>`__ can occur
   when using the TCP protocol for VPN.
4. Create an application account.

.. warning::
    EduVPN enables listening to multiple protocols (UDP/TCP) and ports at the
    same time. Be aware that all nodes need to be connected using the same
    protocol and port in order to communicate with each other.

.. warning::
    The EduVPN server should usually be available to the public internet to
    allow all nodes to find it. Therefore, it should be properly secured, for
    example by closing all public ports (except http/https).

    Additionally, you may want to explicitly allow *only* VPN traffic between
    nodes, and not between a node and the VPN server. You can achieve that by
    updating the firewall rules on your machine.

    On Debian machines, these rules can be found in `/etc/iptables/rules.v4` and `/etc/iptables/rules.v6`, on CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora they can be found in `/etc/sysconfig/iptables` and `/etc/sysconfig/ip6tables`.  You will have to do the following:

    .. raw:: html

        <details>
        <summary><a>Iptables rules to prevent node-to-VPN-server communication</a></summary>

    .. code:: bash

        # In the firewall rules, below INPUT in the #SSH section, add this line
        # to drop all VPN traffic with the VPN server as final destination:
        -I INPUT -i tun+ -j DROP

        # We only want to allow nodes to reach other nodes, and not other
        # network interfaces available in the VPN.
        # To achieve, replace the following rules:
        -A FORWARD -i tun+ ! -o tun+ -j ACCEPT
        -A FORWARD ! -i tun+ -o tun+ -j ACCEPT
        # with:
        -A FORWARD -i tun+ -o tun+ -j ACCEPT
        -A FORWARD -i tun+ -j DROP

        </details>

**Example configuration**

The following configuration makes a server
listens to ``TCP/443`` only. Make sure you set ``clientToClient`` to
``true`` and ``blockLan`` to ``false``. The ``range`` needs to be supplied to
the node configuration files. Also note that the server configured below
uses
`port-sharing <https://github.com/eduvpn/documentation/blob/v2/PORT_SHARING.md>`__.

.. _rabbitmq-install:

RabbitMQ
""""""""


RabbitMQ is an optional component that enables the server to handle more
requests at the same time. This is important if a server has a high workload.

There are several options to host your own RabbitMQ server. You can run
`RabbitMQ in Docker <https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq>`__ or host
`RabbitMQ on
Azure <https://www.golinuxcloud.com/install-rabbitmq-on-azure/>`__. When
you have set up your RabbitMQ service, you can connect the server to it
by adding the following to the server configuration:

::

   rabbitmq_uri: amqp://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:5672/<vhost>

Be sure to create the user and vhost that you specify exist! Otherwise,
you can add them via the `RabbitMQ management
console <https://www.cloudamqp.com/blog/part3-rabbitmq-for-beginners_the-management-interface.html>`__.

.. _smtp-server:

SMTP server
"""""""""""

Some features of the server require an SMTP server to send emails. For example,
the server can send an email to a user when they lost their password. There
are many ways to set up an SMTP server, and we will not go into detail here.
Just remember that you need to configure the server to use your SMTP server
(see :ref:`server-config-file-structure`).
