Requirements
------------

.. note::

    The requirements for the hub are very similar to the
    :ref:`node requirements <node-requirements>`.

.. |requirement-public-ip| replace:: *Note that the IP addresses of hub components should also be reachable by all users and nodes. This usually means there should be one or more public IP addresses.*
.. |requirement-OS| replace:: \
.. |installation-note| replace:: \
    Ubuntu is highly recommended as operating system. It is possible to run a
    vantage6 hub for development on Windows or MacOS, but for production purposes we
    recommend using Ubuntu.
