Technical documentation pages
====================================

Welcome to the technical documentation of the vantage6 project. The following information should be here:

- Design of vantage6
- Internal function documentation
- DevOps

These pages do not include any user documentation, therefore you need to be at our user `documentation <https://docs.vantage6.ai>`_.

Other possible interesting resources:

* `vantage6 <https://vantage6.ai>`_ - our main project site
* `Github <https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6>`_ - source code of the project, including this documentation
* `Discord <https://discord.gg/yAyFf6Y>`_ - Chat with us!
